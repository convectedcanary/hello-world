# hello-world
Following the GitHub guide and trying to understand the basics.

Used to play around with webdevelopment when I was younger.
Pretty sure HTML and Java were the only languages required then and the only ones I looked at.
Trying again and so far I am enjoying it.
Looking to do this as a hobby to begin with.
Long term would like to try and switch careers.
So far I am finding it more engaging, creative and satisfying.
